In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can occur when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  If a server component fetches data that depends on data fetched by a parent component, and an error occurs in the child component's data fetching, the error might not properly propagate up to the parent, leading to a silent failure or unexpected behavior.  This is especially problematic when using `async/await` within nested fetches and error handling isn't meticulously implemented at each level.
