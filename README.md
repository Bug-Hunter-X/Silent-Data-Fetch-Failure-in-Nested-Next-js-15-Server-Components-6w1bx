# Silent Data Fetch Failure in Nested Next.js 15 Server Components

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 server components involving nested data fetching and error handling.  When fetching data within nested server components, errors in child components may not propagate correctly to the parent, leading to silent failures.

## Problem Description

The problem occurs when a server component makes data requests that depend on data from a parent component. If an error happens during the child component's data fetch, this error isn't consistently propagated to the parent, causing unexpected behavior or missing error states.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior (or lack thereof) when data fetching in the nested component fails.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling in both the parent and child components.  Explicitly handling `try...catch` blocks at each level of data fetching ensures that errors are properly caught and propagated, preventing silent failures.

## Further Improvements

Consider adding centralized error handling for all server components to provide a consistent and informative error experience.
